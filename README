timezoneco plugin for DokuWiki

Set up a different timezone for your dokuwiki.

Install the plugin and go to Admin > Configuration Settings.
Under the "Timezone changer plugin" section, set your timezone
(e.g. "America/Sao_Paulo"). Leave it empty to use the server default.

No core file editing required. The plugin hooks into DokuWiki's
startup event and applies the timezone automatically.

All documentation for this plugin can be found at
https://github.com/drbeco/timezoneco

If you install this plugin manually, make sure it is installed in
lib/plugins/timezoneco/ - if the folder is called different it
will not work!

Please refer to https://www.dokuwiki.org/extensions for additional info
on how to install extensions in DokuWiki.
